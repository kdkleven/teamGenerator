## Install Instructions

Node.js and Inquirer are required for this application to run. Pull down the repository and run the following command to install dependencies:

    npm i
  
This will install Inquirer and Jest.

## Usage Instructions

Open an integrated terminal or bash command prompt and run the following command from the /develop directory:

    node app.js

Then answer each question to build your team. After adding a Manager, select Engineer or Intern to add a new member with that role. When you're finished, select 'Render'.

Your generated team.html file can then be found in the /output folder.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributors are welcome. Just remember, this is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

## Test Instructions

Jest is required to execute tests. Current tests can be found in the /test folder. To run tests, open the terminal and run the following command:

    npm run test

Test results will be displayed in the terminal.
